      <h3 id="module-database-concepts"><strong>Module: Database Concepts</strong></h3>
      <p>A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval,
        manipulation, and management of information. Think of it as a well-organized digital filing cabinet where data
        is stored logically and can be accessed easily. Databases are crucial for various applications, from simple
        contact lists to complex enterprise systems.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Key Terminology:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> Raw facts, figures, and symbols. Examples: “John Doe,” “25,” “New York.”</li>
        <li><strong>Information:</strong> Processed data that has meaning and context. Example: “John Doe, age 25, lives
          in New York.”</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> An organized collection of interrelated data.</li>
        <li><strong>DBMS (Database Management System):</strong> Software that controls the creation, maintenance, and
          use of databases. Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.</li>
        <li><strong>Table:</strong> A structured set of data organized in rows (records) and columns (fields or
          attributes).</li>
        <li><strong>Record (or Row or Tuple):</strong> Represents a single instance of an entity in a table. Example: A
          single customer’s information.</li>
        <li><strong>Field (or Column or Attribute):</strong> Represents a specific characteristic of an entity. Example:
          Customer’s name, age, address.</li>
        <li><strong>Schema:</strong> The structure or blueprint of a database, defining tables, fields, data types, and
          relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Instance:</strong> The actual data stored in the database at a specific point in time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. Types of Databases:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relational Database (RDBMS):</strong> Data is organized into tables with relationships between them.
          Most common type.</li>
        <li><strong>NoSQL Database:</strong> Not based on the relational model. Suitable for large datasets and flexible
          schemas. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Database (OODBMS):</strong> Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented
          programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph Database:</strong> Focuses on relationships between data points. Useful for social networks,
          recommendation systems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. Advantages of using a DBMS:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensures data accuracy and consistency through constraints and validation
          rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Controls access to data and protects it from unauthorized users.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Efficiency:</strong> Minimizes data redundancy and storage space.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sharing and Concurrency:</strong> Allows multiple users to access and modify data
          simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery:</strong> Provides mechanisms for backing up and restoring data in case of
          failures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4. Example (Relational Database Table - Customers):</strong></p>

      <h2 id="ca-271-vsec-python-programming">CA-271-VSEC: Python Programming</h2>
      <h3 id="module-advanced-python-programming"><strong>Module: Advanced Python Programming</strong></h3>
      <p>Building upon the basics of Python, this module delves into more advanced concepts and techniques that empower
        you to write more efficient, robust, and sophisticated programs.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Deeper Dive:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inheritance (and Multiple Inheritance):</strong> Creating new classes (child classes) that inherit
          properties and methods from existing classes (parent classes). Exploring the complexities and considerations
          of multiple inheritance.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of objects to take on many forms. Understanding method overriding
          and how it enables flexible and reusable code.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within
          a class. Exploring access modifiers (public, private, protected) and their role in data hiding and
          abstraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Simplifying complex systems by presenting only essential information to the
          user. Understanding abstract classes and interfaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. Decorators:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding Decorators:</strong> Functions that modify the behavior of other functions without
          directly changing their code. A powerful tool for adding functionality like logging, timing, or access
          control.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating and Using Decorators:</strong> Practical examples of creating and applying decorators to
          functions and methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorator Chaining:</strong> Combining multiple decorators to apply multiple functionalities to a
          single function.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. Generators and Iterators:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Iterators:</strong> Objects that allow you to traverse a sequence of data. Understanding the
          <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Generators:</strong> Functions that produce a sequence of values one at a time, using the
          <code>yield</code> keyword. More memory-efficient than storing an entire sequence in memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Generator Expressions:</strong> Concise syntax for creating generators similar to list
          comprehensions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4. Exception Handling - Advanced Techniques:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom Exceptions:</strong> Creating your own exception classes to handle specific error scenarios
          in your applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception Chaining:</strong> Linking exceptions together to provide more context and trace the root
          cause of errors.</li>
        <li><strong><code>finally</code> Clause:</strong> Ensuring that certain code is executed regardless of whether
          an exception is raised or not.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>5. File I/O - Working with Different File Formats:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CSV Files:</strong> Reading and writing data to CSV (Comma Separated Values) files using the
          <code>csv</code> module.</li>
        <li><strong>JSON Files:</strong> Working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data using the <code>json</code>
          module. Parsing JSON strings into Python objects and serializing Python objects into JSON strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Other File Formats:</strong> Briefly exploring other file formats and relevant libraries (e.g., XML,
          YAML).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>6. Modules and Packages:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creating and Using Modules:</strong> Organizing code into reusable modules.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating and Distributing Packages:</strong> Bundling multiple modules into packages for easier
          distribution and installation.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Environments:</strong> Managing dependencies and isolating project environments using
          virtual environments (e.g., <code>venv</code>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example (Decorator):</strong></p>
      <pre><code>python
import time

def timeit(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time
