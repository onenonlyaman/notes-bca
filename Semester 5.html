      <h3 id="module-software-development-lifecycle-sdlc"><strong>Module: Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and deploy
        high-quality software systems. This module explores the various phases of the SDLC, different SDLC models, and
        their importance in creating robust and maintainable software.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Phases of the SDLC:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning/Requirement Analysis:</strong> Gathering and analyzing user requirements, defining project
          scope, and creating a detailed plan. This phase involves extensive communication with stakeholders to
          understand their needs and expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Creating a blueprint for the software system, including architecture, user
          interface (UI), and database design. This phase translates requirements into a technical specification.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation (Coding):</strong> Writing the actual code for the software system based on the
          design specifications. This phase involves choosing appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Evaluating the software to identify defects and ensure it meets the specified
          requirements. This includes various testing types, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing,
          and user acceptance testing (UAT).</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Releasing the software to the end-users. This involves installing the software
          on servers, configuring the environment, and providing user training and documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment, including bug
          fixes, performance enhancements, and new feature additions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. SDLC Models:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> A linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before the
          next begins. Simple to understand but less flexible for changes in requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Model:</strong> An iterative and incremental approach emphasizing flexibility and
          collaboration. Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing,
          cross-functional teams. Examples: Scrum, Kanban.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiral Model:</strong> Combines elements of both waterfall and iterative models, emphasizing risk
          management. Each iteration involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>V-Model:</strong> Emphasizes the relationship between testing and development. Testing activities
          are planned in parallel with development phases.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype Model:</strong> Creating a working prototype of the software early in the development
          process to gather user feedback and refine requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. Importance of SDLC:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Ensures that the software meets quality standards and user expectations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> Early detection and correction of defects reduces development costs and
          rework.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Communication:</strong> Facilitates clear communication and collaboration among
          stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Project Management:</strong> Provides a structured framework for managing the project and
          tracking progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Streamlines the development process and improves efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4. Choosing the Right SDLC Model:</strong></p>
      <p>The choice of SDLC model depends on various factors, including project size, complexity, risk tolerance, and
        team expertise.</p>
      <p><strong>Example (Waterfall Model):</strong></p>
      <p>Imagine building a simple website. Using the Waterfall model:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Gather requirements like the website’s purpose, content, and target audience.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Create a website layout, design the user interface, and plan the database
          structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the website.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test the website’s functionality, usability, and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Publish the website to a web server.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Fix bugs, update content, and add new features as needed.</li>
      </ol>

        (VR), exploring their applications, technologies, and potential impact on various industries.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Defining AR and VR:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR):</strong> An interactive experience of a real-world environment where the
          objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes
          across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. Overlays
          digital information onto the real world. Examples: Pokémon GO, Snapchat filters.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR):</strong> A simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different
          from the real world. Immerses users in a fully digital environment. Examples: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Reality (MR):</strong> A blend of real and virtual worlds, allowing digital and real-world
          objects to coexist and interact in real time. A more advanced form of AR. Examples: Microsoft HoloLens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. Key Components of AR/VR Systems:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Head-mounted displays (HMDs), smartphones, tablets, sensors, controllers.</li>
        <li><strong>Software:</strong> Development platforms, SDKs, game engines, 3D modeling software.</li>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> 3D models, animations, audio, video, interactive elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. AR Applications:</strong></p>

        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Enhancing gameplay by overlaying digital elements onto the real world.</li>
        <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Allowing customers to try on clothes or visualize furniture in their homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Creating interactive learning experiences and simulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Assisting surgeons with complex procedures or providing virtual therapy
          sessions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4. VR Applications:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Creating immersive and interactive gaming experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Training and Simulation:</strong> Simulating real-world scenarios for training purposes, such as
          flight simulators or medical training.</li>
        <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Experiencing virtual concerts, travel destinations, or art exhibits.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Treating phobias and PTSD through exposure therapy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>5. Challenges and Future Trends:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> Improving hardware performance, reducing latency, enhancing tracking
          accuracy.</li>

        <li><strong>Accessibility and Affordability:</strong> Making AR/VR technology accessible to a wider audience.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Addressing privacy concerns and potential misuse of AR/VR
          technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Trends:</strong> Integration of AI, 5G, and other technologies to enhance AR/VR experiences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example (AR Application - Furniture Placement App):</strong></p>
      <p>A furniture placement app allows users to view virtual furniture in their real-world living room using their
        smartphone or tablet. This allows users to visualize how different furniture pieces would look and fit in their
        space before making a purchase.</p>
